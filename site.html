  Built in 1555 for a wealthy Toulouse merchant, this fairy tale pink palace is worth a visit just for its stunning Renaissance architecture, but since 1994 it has also housed the Bemberg Foundation’s art collection. Five centuries of breathtaking paintings are exhibited in intimate salons: Canaletto, Brueghel, Bosch, Tintoretto. Modern masters include Picasso, Toulouse-Lautrec, Cézanne and Matisse, with one room dedicated to 30 works by Pierre Bonnard.
